# Course on Large Language Models (LLMs)

Welcome to the "Course on Large Language Models," a structured educational resource designed to deepen your understanding and practical skills with Large Language Models (LLMs) using OpenAI's platform.

## Overview
This course is divided into five main parts, each focusing on a key aspect of working with LLMs. Starting from basic API connections to advanced topics like embeddings and function calling, this course offers a comprehensive journey through the capabilities of LLMs.

## What You Will Learn
 * **API Connections:** How to establish and manage connections with LLMs through APIs.
 * **Completion Parameters:** Understanding and manipulating parameters for tailored outputs.
 * **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques for crafting effective prompts to guide the model's responses.
 * **Embeddings:** Leveraging embeddings for deeper model understanding and comparison.
 * **Function Calling:** Advanced uses of LLMs, including dynamic function calling within prompts.

## Extras
Beyond the core content, the course provides additional insights into:

* Creating and managing your API key for OpenAI.
* Running local instances of LLMs for development and testing.
* Understanding the context window's importance.
* Usage of Virtual Memory for large-scale LLMs.
* Strategies for fine-tuning LLMs to specific needs.

## Prerequisites
* Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended).
* An API key from OpenAI.

## How to Use This Notebook
